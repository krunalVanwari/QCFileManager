# QCFileManager

A small set of functions which helps to save and retrive 'Data' format locally. No need to store data in UserDefault because it loads all the saved data at Launch, so more the data more it takes time to launch the app. CoreData is a sophisticated way of saving data which needs time so, best thing is to save it in User's directry and with 'QCFileManager' you don't need to write complex code to access files, we will handle all that for you!.
